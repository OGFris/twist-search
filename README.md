# twist-search
*A search engine app for Anime Twist.*

This is [twist.moe](https://twist.moe/)'s search API part, it uses Elasticsearch and Mysql as a backup plan. It also implements a migration function from Mysql to Elasticsearch.

**NOTE:** *This code should be used as an example only because part of the project that is being imported is private so this repository is basically useless without the rest of the codes.*
